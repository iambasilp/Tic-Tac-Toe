## Introduction
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game. Players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) wins. This project uses React for the user interface and custom CSS3 for styling.

## Features
- Two-player game mode
- Easy-to-use interface
- Highlights the winning combination
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Clean, modern look with custom CSS3

## Installation
To set up the project on your computer:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iambasilp/tic-tac-toe.git
   ```
2. **Go to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd tic-tac-toe
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage
To start the game, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to play the game.

## Key Concepts
Here are some key ideas used in this project:

- **Game Loop:** The main cycle that controls the game, checks for player moves, updates the game state, and displays the game board.
- **State Management:** Using React's state and hooks to track the game state, including player moves, the current player, and checking for wins or draws.
- **User Interface:** Creating the game board and other elements using React components and styling them with custom CSS3.
- **Algorithms:** Logic to check for winning combinations and draw conditions.
- **Event Handling:** Managing user actions (like clicks) to update the game state.
- **Responsive Design:** Using CSS3 to make sure the game looks good on different devices and screen sizes.
